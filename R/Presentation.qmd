## Introduction

- Diabetes is estimated to affect approximately 530 million adults worldwide, with a global prevalence of 10.5 percent among adults aged 20 to 79 years. ^[IDF Diabetes Atlas 2021, 10th edition https://diabetesatlas.org/atlas/tenth-edition/ (Accessed on January 17, 2022)]

- Type 2 diabetes represents approximately 98 percent of global diabetes diagnoses, although this proportion varies widely among 

- Evaluate the possible factors that affect the appearance of Diabetes Type 2, for further control and prevention.

## Principal component analysis

- After having scaled and centred the data, we performed PCA to test the correlation between multiple properties in a two-dimensional space.

## Principal component analysis

- As we can see, there's no clear separation between the two classes using the two best principal components.

- The reason can be traced back to how much variance is explained by each principal component.

## Principal component analysis

- The first two principal components only account for around 50% of the total variance.

- To reach at least 90%, we would have to include 6 PC out of 8.

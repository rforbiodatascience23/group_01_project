## Introduction

- Diabetes is estimated to affect approximately 530 million adults worldwide, with a global prevalence of 10.5 percent among adults aged 20 to 79 years. ^[IDF Diabetes Atlas 2021, 10th edition https://diabetesatlas.org/atlas/tenth-edition/ (Accessed on January 17, 2022)]

- Type 2 diabetes represents approximately 98 percent of global diabetes diagnoses, although this proportion varies widely among 

- Evaluate the possible factors that affect the appearance of Diabetes Type 2, for further control and prevention.

## Materials and Methods
### Data Acquisition and Description

## Materials and Methods
### Data Cleaning, Augmentation and Analysis

-   Data Loading: Automatic data loading from server.
-   Data Cleaning: Several zero values treated as NA. In the case of Insulin, only treated as NA if the patient was diabetic.
-   Data Augmentation: Columns renamed to improve clarity and new categories created for BMI and Age.
-   Data Description & Analysis: Data analyzed and visualized statistically and graphically. Use of Principal Component Analysis to understand correlation between variables.

## Correlation heatmap

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
- Expected strong correlation between BMI and skin thickness, since skin layer thickness increases with BMI increase
- Weak correlation between insulin and glucose levels, possibly since insulin levels increase when glucose levels rise in the blood durng the OGTT.

## Principal component analysis

- After having scaled and centred the data, we performed PCA to test the correlation between multiple properties in a two-dimensional space.

## Principal component analysis

- As we can see, there's no clear separation between the two classes using the two best principal components.

- The reason can be traced back to how much variance is explained by each principal component.

## Principal component analysis

- The first two principal components only account for around 50% of the total variance.

- To reach at least 90%, we would have to include 6 PC out of 8.

## BMI class distribution
- Reveals the distribution of diabetes cases across distinct BMI categories.
- Provides a clear depiction of diabetes prevalence among various BMI groups.
- Illustrates the correlation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and diabetes occurrences.

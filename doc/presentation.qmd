## Introduction

- Diabetes is estimated to affect approximately 530 million adults worldwide, with a global prevalence of 10.5 percent among adults aged 20 to 79 years. ^[IDF Diabetes Atlas 2021, 10th edition https://diabetesatlas.org/atlas/tenth-edition/ (Accessed on January 17, 2022)]

- Type 2 diabetes represents approximately 98 percent of global diabetes diagnoses, although this proportion varies widely among 

- Evaluate the possible factors that affect the appearance of Diabetes Type 2, for further control and prevention.

## Data Acquisition and Description

![](../results/violin_plot.png)


## Data Cleaning, Augmentation and Analysis

-   Data Loading: Automatic data loading from server.
-   Data Cleaning: Several zero values treated as NA. In the case of Insulin, only treated as NA if the patient was diabetic.
-   Data Augmentation: Columns renamed to improve clarity and new categories created for BMI and Age.
-   Data Description & Analysis: Data analyzed and visualized statistically and graphically. Use of Principal Component Analysis to understand correlation between variables.

## Correlation heatmap

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.r-fit-text}
- Expected strong correlation between BMI and skin thickness, since skin layer thickness increases with BMI increase.

- Weak correlation between insulin and glucose levels, possibly since insulin levels increase when glucose levels rise in the blood during the OGTT.

## Principal component analysis

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}
::: {.r-fit-text}
- The data was scaled and centred before performing PCA.

- There's no clear separation between the two classes using only the two best PC.

- The first two principal components only account for around 50% of the total variance.

- To reach at least 90%, we would have to include 6 PC out of 8.

## Discussion

- We analysed a dataset containing clinical data about 768 patients, some of them suffering from diabetes.

- While we've found some correlation between individual properties, it's hard to tell whether someone is ill just from a subset of features.

- We've found a linear correlation between blood pressure and skin thickness.

- PCA couldn't separate ill individuals from healthy people using only the two best PC.

- Obesity is a risk factor for diabetes.
